## Jigsaw Capstone Project: Predict Customer Churn Probability

### Problem Statement
At Mobicom telecom, customer churn rate is relatively high. Currently, they have been focusing on reactive basis when the customer calls in to close the account. But this alone does not seem to be enough and the management team is keen to take more intiatives on this front. One of these is to roll out targeted proactive retention programs, which include usage enhancing marketing programs to increase minutes of usage (MOU), rate plan migration and a bundling strategy among others. To effectively drive these retention strategies, a few questions of interest requires databased insights and recommendations relating to customer churn.

### Top Line Questions of interest to Seniro Management:
1. What are top five factors driving likelihood of churn at Mobicom?
2. Validation of survey findings.
    * a) Whether "cost and billing" and "network and service quality" are important factors influencing churn behaviour.
    * b) Are data usage connectivity issues turning out to be costly? In other words, is it leading to churn?
3. Would you recommend rate plan migration as a proactive retention strtategy?
4. What would be your recommendation on how to use this churn model for prioritisation of customers for a proactive retention campaigns in the future?
5. What would be the target segments for proactive retention campaigns? Mobicom would like to save their high revenue customers besides managing churn. Given a budget constraint of a contact list of 20% of the subscriber pool, which subscribers should be prioritised if "revenue saves" is also a priority bseides controlling churn. In other words, controlling churn is the primary objective and revenue saves is the secondary objective.
